# Credit-Approval
the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 highlighted the importance of transparency and rigor in banking practices.As the availability of credit was limited, banks tightened their lending systems and turned to machine learning to more accurately identify risky loans.


Decision trees are widely used in the banking industry due to their high accuracy and ability to formulate a statistical model in plain language. Since government oranizations in many countries carefully monitor lending practices, executives must be able to explain why one applicant was rejected  for a loan while the others were approved. This information is also useful for customers hoping to determine why their credit rating is unsatisfactory.


It is likely that automated credit scoring models are employed to instantly approve credit applications on the telephone and web.We will delevop a simple credit approval model using C5.0 decision trees. We will also see how the results of the model can be tuned to tuned to minimize errors that result in a financial loss for the institution.

The idea behind our credit model is to identify factors that are predictive of higher risk of default.Therefore, we need to obtain data on a large number of past bank loans and whether the loan went into default,as well as information on the aplicant.
